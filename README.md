# Java-GettingHardwareInformation

Running this code will show the hardware information.

I believe the commenting on the code is clear enough.

If there is any issue with the code, just holler :)

This code has been tested on Windows 8.1, Linux Mint and Mac OS Yosemite

*Note that this is upload as an Eclipse project. You should be able to clone this and run it in Eclipse. Plus, the codes and resources are direct enough to port over to netbeans or any other IDE of your choice.
